      <img src="Photos/Cleric.jpeg" alt="Cleric" width=400 height=200 />
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Cleric is generally seen as the healer of the party, it is one of the best classes overall. Not only can they heal, and pretty well at that, they also are one of the most powerful damaging classes. They can fill almost any role, with a large variety of subclasses, which are picked at first level, that all feel different and unique while filling out different roles in the party. Overall, Cleric is a jack of all trades, master of all.

      <h2 id="R2">2. Rogue</h2>
      <img src="Photos/Rogue.jpeg" alt="Rogue" width=400 height=200 />
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rogues are <em>powerful</em>. They are the best class in the game for skills, they do some of the most single-hit damage in the game CONSISTENTLY, and they have a standard amount of health--Not even a weakness! They also aren't weak at range, and are even better at range than in melee, which they are very good at. With them only needing one stat, Dexterity, that stat being the best stat in the game, and them having the second-most Ability Score Improvements in the game, they can also get a TON of feats that makes the Rogue extremly powerful. However, they do have one weakness: They don't get good spellcasting capabilities, but they do make up for that with a lot of utility from skills. However, at higher levels, the linear scaling of their damage doesn't keep up with the exponential scaling of spellcasters.

      <h2>3. Warlock</h2>
      <img src="Photos/Warlock.jpeg" alt="Warlock" width=200 height=200 />
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warlocks are often thought of as being the class that struggles with lack of resources. However, they are actually the class that can keep their resources going throughout the entire day, with their unlimited invocations, the powerful buffs to the eldritch blast cantrip, and them recharging their spell slots on a short rest. In addition, they are by far the most versatile class in the game, with their invocations covering almost every playstyle and doing it well. They are the best class for being a martial spellcaster, can be the class with the most ranged options, be one of the highest damaging classes, be one of the sneakiest classes, and even do a large amount of damage every turn.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bards are one of the most versatile classes, as well as being one of the best spellcasting classes. if you want to take spirit guardians and counterspell, they are the only class that can do so without multiclassing. It its spell list is quite expansive on its own, and the ability to take any spell from any list allows for many spell combos that are extremly powerful. In addition, the base class is very good, with a large amount of subclasses varying in uses. They are also the best class for skill monkeys.

      <h2>5. Fighter</h2>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fighters get a lot of attacks. And they can heal themself. And they get the most overpowered ability at level two, making them a great class to multiclass into. They also have a large variety of directions you can go, making them incredibly versatile and powerful.

      <h2>6. Paladin</h2>
      <img src="Photos/Paladin.jpeg" alt="Paladin" width=200 height=200 />
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paladins do a lot of damage with smite, and can have a high AC and health. The only problem is that smite is based on spell slots, making it difficult for them to do much at range.

      <h2>7. Sorcerer</h2>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorcerer can do a lot of damage with their spells, with metamagic buffing the spells. They do have a low amount of health and limited spells known being the main downsides.

      <h2>8. Artificer</h2>
      <img src="Photos/Artificer.jpeg" alt="Artificer" width=200 height=200 />
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificier have a lot of potential, but it is ruined by their limited infusions able to be in use at the same time, and half of the subclasses being very lackluster. They also aren't in the base game, so you have to get another book to use it.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#129413; Druids can turn into animals, which makes them tankier, but unless you are high level in a specific subclass, you can't cast spells and as such don't do a lot of damage while wildshaped, with the animals you can turn into being very lackluster, and as such their main ability is only useful for tanking.

      <h2>10. Barbarian</h2>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbarians have a lot of health and can take less damage, making them very tanky, and can do extra damage, particularly on crits, but they have very limited ranged options and can't cast spells while they are raging, making it very difficult to get a ranged option.
      </p>

    <div id="R11">

      <h2>11. Ranger</h2>
      <img src="Photos/Ranger.jpeg" alt="Ranger" width=200 height=200 />
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rangers are very niche, but they are the only class that can fill that niche. The lack of exploration in most campaigns really hurts them, and with them choosing one terrain type and enemy to be good with makes them worse in long-running games because in those, there is generally a variety of terrain and enemies used.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Wizard</h2>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wizards are good, but there just isn't a point in playing them. Whatever you want to do, another class does better. Martial-based spellcaster? Hexblade/Eldritch knight. Support spellcaster? Bard. Blasting caster? Sorcerer. Wizard just isn't the best at anything, and there is no point to playing one.

      <h2>13. Monk</h2>
      <img src="Photos/Monk.jpeg" alt="Monk" width=200 height=200 />
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monks punch things a lot, and hard. Or so they want you to think, but Fighter does that better. A level one fighter does as much damage with a punch as a level 16 monk. And can end up with more attacks. The only useful thing about monks is stunning strike and a few other ki-related abilities, but the problem is, the ki points are far too limited to take full advantage of them.
