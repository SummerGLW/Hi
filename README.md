# HTML

These are my extra items:
1. I spent a lot of time working on the layout of the page
2. I added dark mode, which along with being good for the eyes makes the site more accessible to people with photophobia, who are very sensitve to light, and could even help them not have photophobia as it is sometimes caused by their eyes being exposed to too much light
